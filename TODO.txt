- Remove countdownValue from database diagram

- Restructure database diagram so Room sits at the very top

Changes 24/11/23:
* When deleting a room entry from the database, all relevant records associated with it will be cascade-deleted

* Data will no longer be persisted between server restarts as there is no need to persist room data on shutdown

* Finished socket communication for game setup phase (player count requirement, countdown, game status change)

* Added popup for game status "SUSPENDED"

* Added extra field validation for invite code and username on the server side

* Moved canvas-related state, effects and events to a dedicated component instead of separate plain JS files

* Added dotted line on node hover (move preview) to indicate where you can move the ball. Only the active player can see and use it

* Disabled node interaction for the inactive player

* Fixed bug that allowed one of the players to restart the match if they refreshed the page

* Fixed bug that made socket errors overwrite each other in GameScreen when two or more errors occured at a time. Now the first error to appear takes priority
